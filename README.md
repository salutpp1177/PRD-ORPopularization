# Android Game Platform for Operations Research Popularization

### Brief
This is my final project in **[Polytech Tours](https://polytech.univ-tours.fr)**, which intends to popularize the **[Operations Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research)** ( a sub-field of applied mathematics ) by building a game platform. As the start-up creator for this platform, my tutors and I decided to create a game about how to cook the pizzas as the first game in this platform.

Through this **cooking-pizza** game, we want to convey the ideas about the **[Flow shop scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_shop_scheduling)** problem. In this case, the game simulates the process of making pizza to relate a classic operations research problem, **Two-Machine Flow Shop Scheduling** problem. 

### Specifications
Android 4.4 KitKat, Java 8, Developped with ***Android Studio***

### Overview
Our platform is bilingual: English and French, supports all Android devices ( at least version **Android 4.4** ). 
In the flowshop-pizza game, you need to select all the pizzas, of course, you can drag and drop the pizzas to change their order.
